# Risk Analyzer

## Overview
**Risk Analyzer** is a Python-based tool/notebook designed to analyze and visualize risks associated with financial, business, or project datasets. It leverages Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data analysis, visualization, and risk computation.

This project provides:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Risk scoring and analysis
- Visualizations to highlight potential high-risk areas
- Summary reports

## Features
- Import datasets in CSV or Excel format
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Calculate risk metrics and scores
- Generate visualizations for risk analysis
- Export analyzed results and visualizations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Risk_Analyzer
````

2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** Typical dependencies include:
>
> * pandas
> * numpy
> * matplotlib
> * seaborn
> * scikit-learn (if applicable)

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Risk_Analyzer.ipynb
```

2. Follow the notebook steps to:

   * Load your dataset
   * Preprocess and clean the data
   * Compute risk scores
   * Generate visualizations
   * Export results

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/sample_data.csv')

# Run risk analysis (example function from notebook)
risk_scores = analyze_risks(data)
visualize_risks(risk_scores)
```
